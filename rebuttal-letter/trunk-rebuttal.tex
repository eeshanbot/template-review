\section{Reviewer One}

\subsection*{Summary}

\ebline{\lipsum[1]}

\lipsum[2]

\subsection*{Comments}

\lreviewer{Line 12}{v1:1.1}
{You say ``Duis eget orci sit amet orci dignissim rutrum''. Please check the grammar.}
This is correct. We have not changed it.

Note that the first instance of Line 12 comes from the user manually copying it over from the reviewer.
The second instance of 12 comes from the label \emph{in your draft revision}.
This label should be set by you right after you read the review (most likely, this is a good use of your time, too).
Your rebuttal letter will automatically keep track of where the changes you make end up being in the revised manuscript as long as you don't delete the original command: \texttt{$\backslash$llabel\{ tag \}}.

If you need to put the line number directly in the text, you can simply use \texttt{$\backslash$ref\{ prefix tag \}}. 
Please note that there will be a prefix added to your tag from the other document, which you can change in \texttt{$\backslash$externaldocument[prefix]\{ path to document \}} in \texttt{preamble.tex}.

\lreviewer{Line 50}{}{This doesn't make any sense to me.}
\label{sec:test}
Notice that this uses the same macro, \texttt{$\backslash$lreviewer}, but leaves the second input blank.

\section{Reviewer Two}

\lreviewer{Line 50}{}{This statement is confusing as written.}

Thank you. We have removed this accordingly. This agrees with Comment \ref{sec:test}.

\lreviewer{Line 99}{}{Please check Schrodinger's cat.}

The cat in the box is \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{dead}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{alive}\DIFaddend .
